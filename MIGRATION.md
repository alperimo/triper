# Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What Changed

Successfully migrated from flat Next.js project to **professional monorepo structure** with **pnpm**.

### Before
```
triper/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (npm)
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### After
```
triper/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ web/              # Frontend (was root)
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/        # NEW: Rust/Anchor smart contracts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sdk/              # NEW: Shared TypeScript SDK
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/            # NEW: Shared types
â”œâ”€â”€ pnpm-workspace.yaml   # NEW: Monorepo config
â”œâ”€â”€ turbo.json            # NEW: Build system
â””â”€â”€ package.json          # NEW: Root scripts
```

## Benefits

### 1. Better Organization
- **Separation**: Frontend vs contracts vs shared code
- **Reusability**: Share types between web and contracts
- **Scalability**: Easy to add mobile app, CLI tools, etc.

### 2. Performance
- **pnpm**: Faster installs (hard links instead of copying)
- **Turborepo**: Cached builds, parallel execution
- **Workspace**: Single `node_modules` at root

### 3. Professional Structure
- Industry standard for Web3 projects
- Easy onboarding for contributors
- Clear project boundaries

## Smart Contract Added!

Created full Anchor/Rust program at `packages/contracts/programs/triper/src/lib.rs`:

### Key Features

```rust
#[program]
pub mod triper {
    // Create encrypted trip
    pub fn create_trip(
        encrypted_route: Vec<u8>,
        encrypted_dates: Vec<u8>,
        encrypted_interests: Vec<u8>,
    ) -> Result<()>

    // MPC matching (runs in Arcium enclave)
    #[confidential]
    pub fn compute_match(
        trip_a_route: Vec<u32>,  // Decrypted in secure env
        trip_b_route: Vec<u32>,
        // ...
    ) -> Result<MatchResult>

    // Record match on-chain
    pub fn record_match(...)

    // Mutual consent flow
    pub fn accept_match(...)
}
```

### Matching Algorithm

Weighted score (0-100):
- **40%**: Route overlap (grid cell intersection)
- **30%**: Date overlap (temporal intersection)
- **30%**: Interest similarity (travel style match)

Only matches >50% are returned.

## Commands

### Development
```bash
pnpm dev              # Start Next.js (same as before)
pnpm build            # Build all packages
pnpm lint             # Lint everything
pnpm test             # Run all tests
```

### Smart Contracts
```bash
pnpm contracts:build  # Compile Rust
pnpm contracts:test   # Run Anchor tests
pnpm contracts:deploy # Deploy to devnet
```

## What's Working

âœ… Landing page at http://localhost:3000  
âœ… Wallet connection (Phantom)  
âœ… Map visualization (Maplibre)  
âœ… Encrypted aura animations  
âœ… State management (Zustand)  
âœ… Smart contract structure  
âœ… Type safety across workspace  

## Next Steps

1. **Trip Creation UI** - Form to create encrypted trips
2. **Arcium Integration** - Set up MPC SDK
3. **Contract Deployment** - Deploy to Solana devnet
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Verify matching works

## File Locations

### Frontend
- Main page: `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`
- Components: `apps/web/src/components/`
- Stores: `apps/web/src/lib/store/`
- Types: `apps/web/src/types/`

### Smart Contracts
- Main program: `packages/contracts/programs/triper/src/lib.rs`
- Config: `packages/contracts/Anchor.toml`
- Tests: `packages/contracts/tests/` (to be added)

### Documentation
- README: `README.md` (updated)
- Progress: `PROGRESS.md` (new)
- This file: `MIGRATION.md`

## Breaking Changes

None! The migration was non-destructive:
- All existing code moved to `apps/web`
- No functionality changed
- Same dev server port (3000)
- Same commands (just use `pnpm` instead of `npm`)

## Notes

- Removed `package-lock.json` (using `pnpm-lock.yaml` now)
- Added `.gitignore` for monorepo
- Peer dependency warnings are expected (React 19 is new)
- Smart contract is scaffolded but not yet deployed

**Time Taken**: ~30 minutes  
**Impact**: High
**Risk**: Low (non-breaking migration)
